## 📝 Problem Statement

A **self-dividing number** is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

- For example, `128` is **a self-dividing number** because `128 % 1 == 0`, `128 % 2 == 0`, and `128 % 8 == 0`.

A **self-dividing number** is not allowed to contain the digit zero.

Given two integers `left` and `right`, return *a list of all the **self-dividing numbers** in the range* `[left, right]` (both **inclusive**).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: left = 1, right = 22
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,11,12,15,22]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: left = 47, right = 85
Output: [48,55,66,77]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= left <= right <= 104`

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Exhaustive / multi-pass search across candidate elements to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

```python
class Solution:
    def selfDividingNumbers(self, left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
        res = []

        for i in range(left, right + 1):
            num = i

            while num != 0:
                divisor = num % 10

                if divisor == 0 or i % divisor != 0:
                    break

                num //= 10

            if num == 0:
                res.append(i)
                
        return res
```
