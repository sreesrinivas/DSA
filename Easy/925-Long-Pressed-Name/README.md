## 📝 Problem Statement

Your friend is typing his `name` into a keyboard. Sometimes, when typing a character `c`, the key might get *long pressed*, and the character will be typed 1 or more times.

You examine the `typed` characters of the keyboard. Return `True` if it is possible that it was your friends name, with some characters (possibly none) being long pressed.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: name = "alex", typed = "aaleex"
Output: true
Explanation: 'a' and 'e' in 'alex' were long pressed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: name = "saeed", typed = "ssaaedd"
Output: false
Explanation: 'e' must have been pressed twice, but it was not in the typed output.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= name.length, typed.length <= 1000`

- `name` and `typed` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

```python
class Solution:
    def isLongPressedName(self, name: str, typed: str) -> bool:
        if name[0] != typed[0]: return False
        if name == typed: return True
        i = 0
        for ch in typed:
            if i < len(name) and name[i] == ch: i += 1
            else:
                if name[i-1] != ch: return False
        return i == len(name)
```
