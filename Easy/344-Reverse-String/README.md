## 📝 Problem Statement

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`

- `s[i]` is a printable ascii character.

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Two-pointer linear scan adjusting window boundaries based on constraints to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {

        int start = 0;
        int end = s.length - 1;

        while(start <= end){

            char temp = s[start];
            s[start] = s[end];
            s[end] = temp;

            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```
