## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 104`

- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

- `-109 <= target <= 109`

- **Only one valid answer exists.**

 

**Follow-up: **Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n2)` time complexity?

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Hash-table lookup approach enabling constant-time O(1) element retrieval to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        lookup = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num
            if diff in lookup:
                return [lookup[diff], i]
            lookup[num] = i
        return []
