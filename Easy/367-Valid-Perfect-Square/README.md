## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a positive integer num, return `true` *if* `num` *is a perfect square or* `false` *otherwise*.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

You must not use any built-in library function, such as `sqrt`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = 16
Output: true
Explanation: We return true because 4 * 4 = 16 and 4 is an integer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = 14
Output: false
Explanation: We return false because 3.742 * 3.742 = 14 and 3.742 is not an integer.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num <= 231 - 1`

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
