## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary tree.

Return all **root-to-leaf** paths* *in **any order**.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5]
Output: ["1->2->5","1->3"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: ["1"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.

- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

---

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Two-pointer linear scan adjusting window boundaries based on constraints to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

                res.append(path)
            if node.right:
                stack.append((node.right, path + "->" + str(node.right.val)))
            if node.left:
                stack.append((node.left, path + "->" + str(node.left.val)))
        return res
```
