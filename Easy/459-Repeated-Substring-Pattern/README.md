## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abab"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`

- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Binary search approach dividing the search range logarithmically to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

        n = len(s)
        for i in range(1, n//2 + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                substring = s[:i]
                if substring * (n // i) == s:
                    return True
        return False
