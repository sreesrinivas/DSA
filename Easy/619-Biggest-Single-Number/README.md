## 📝 Problem Statement

Table: `MyNumbers`

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| num         | int  |
+-------------+------+
This table may contain duplicates (In other words, there is no primary key for this table in SQL).
Each row of this table contains an integer.
```

 

A **single number** is a number that appeared only once in the `MyNumbers` table.

Find the largest **single number**. If there is no **single number**, report `null`.

The result format is in the following example.

 

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 1   |
| 4   |
| 5   |
| 6   |
+-----+
Output: 
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 6   |
+-----+
Explanation: The single numbers are 1, 4, 5, and 6.
Since 6 is the largest single number, we return it.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
MyNumbers table:
+-----+
| num |
+-----+
| 8   |
| 8   |
| 7   |
| 7   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
| 3   |
+-----+
Output: 
+------+
| num  |
+------+
| null |
+------+
Explanation: There are no single numbers in the input table so we return null.
```
