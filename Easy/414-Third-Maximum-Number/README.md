## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`.

Return the **third distinct maximum** number in this array. If the third **maximum** does not exist, return the **maximum** number.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 2.
The second distinct maximum is 1.
The third distinct maximum does not exist, so the maximum (2) is returned instead.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2 (both 2's are counted together since they have the same value).
The third distinct maximum is 1.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`

- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

 

**Follow up:** Can you find an `O(n)` solution?

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def thirdMax(self, nums):
        first = second = third = None
        for num in nums:
            if num == first or num == second or num == third:
                continue
            if first is None or num > first:
                third = second
                second = first
                first = num
            elif second is None or num > second:
                third = second
                second = num
            elif third is None or num > third:
                third = num
        return third if third is not None else first
```
