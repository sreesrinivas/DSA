## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the `root` of an n-ary tree, return *the postorder traversal of its nodes' values*.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal. Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [5,6,3,2,4,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [2,6,14,11,7,3,12,8,4,13,9,10,5,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.

- `0 <= Node.val <= 104`

- The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.

 

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def postorder(self, root):
        # If the root is None, return an empty list
        if not root:
            return []

        res = []

        # Define the DFS function
        def dfs(root):
            # Recursively call dfs for each child of the current node
            for x in root.children:
                dfs(x)
            # Append the value of the current node to the result list
            res.append(root.val)

        # Start DFS from the root
        dfs(root)

        # Return the result list containing node values in post-order
        return res
```
