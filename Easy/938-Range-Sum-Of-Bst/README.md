## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the `root` node of a binary search tree and two integers `low` and `high`, return *the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the **inclusive** range *`[low, high]`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], low = 7, high = 15
Output: 32
Explanation: Nodes 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. 7 + 10 + 15 = 32.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], low = 6, high = 10
Output: 23
Explanation: Nodes 6, 7, and 10 are in the range [6, 10]. 6 + 7 + 10 = 23.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2 * 104]`.

- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`

- `1 <= low <= high <= 105`

- All `Node.val` are **unique**.

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

            current_val = 0
            if low <= node.val <= high:
                current_val = node.val
            
            left_sum = dfs(node.left)
            right_sum = dfs(node.right)
            
            return current_val + left_sum + right_sum
        
        return dfs(root)
```
