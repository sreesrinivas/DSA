## 📝 Problem Statement

You have a `RecentCounter` class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the `RecentCounter` class:

- `RecentCounter()` Initializes the counter with zero recent requests.

- `int ping(int t)` Adds a new request at time `t`, where `t` represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range `[t - 3000, t]`, that is, the new request plus every earlier request that is no more than `3000` milliseconds older.

It is **guaranteed** that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than the previous call.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["RecentCounter", "ping", "ping", "ping", "ping"]
[[], [1], [100], [3001], [3002]]
Output
[null, 1, 2, 3, 3]

Explanation
RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter();
recentCounter.ping(1);     // requests = [1], range is [-2999,1], return 1
recentCounter.ping(100);   // requests = [1, 100], range is [-2900,100], return 2
recentCounter.ping(3001);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001], range is [1,3001], return 3
recentCounter.ping(3002);  // requests = [1, 100, 3001, 3002], range is [2,3002], return 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= t <= 109`

- Each test case will call `ping` with **strictly increasing** values of `t`.

- At most `104` calls will be made to `ping`.

```python
from collections import deque

class RecentCounter:

    def __init__(self):
        self.q = deque()

    def ping(self, t: int) -> int:
        self.q.append(t)

        while self.q and self.q[0] < t - 3000:
            self.q.popleft()

        return len(self.q)
```
