## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`

- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

 

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

```python
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        snowBallSize = 0
        for i in range(0, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                snowBallSize += 1
            elif snowBallSize > 0:
                t = nums[i]
                nums[i] = 0
                nums[i - snowBallSize] = t
```
