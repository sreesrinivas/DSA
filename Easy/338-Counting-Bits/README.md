## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return *an array *`ans`* of length *`n + 1`* such that for each *`i`* *(`0 <= i <= n`)*, *`ans[i]`* is the **number of ***`1`***'s** in the binary representation of *`i`.

Do not solve it with built-in functions (i.e., like `__builtin_popcount` in C++).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 105`

 

**Follow up:**

- It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of `O(n log n)`. Can you do it in linear time `O(n)` and possibly in a single pass?

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Dynamic programming / memoized recursion approach storing overlapping subproblems to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

```python
class Solution:
    def countBits(self, n: int) -> List[int]:
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        sub = 1

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if sub * 2 == i:
                sub = i
            
            dp[i] = dp[i - sub] + 1
        
        return dp
```
