## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given a license key represented as a string `s` that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into `n + 1` groups by `n` dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

We want to reformat the string `s` such that each group contains exactly `k` characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return *the reformatted license key*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`

- `s` consists of English letters, digits, and dashes `'-'`.

- `1 <= k <= 104`

```java
public String licenseKeyFormatting(String s, int k) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            if (s.charAt(i) != '-')
                sb.append(sb.length() % (k + 1) == k ? '-' : "").append(s.charAt(i));
        return sb.reverse().toString().toUpperCase();
    }
```
