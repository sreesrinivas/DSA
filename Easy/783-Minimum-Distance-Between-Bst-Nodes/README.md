## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return *the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.

- `0 <= Node.val <= 105`

 

**Note:** This question is the same as 530: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-absolute-difference-in-bst/

```python
class Solution(object):
    pre = -float('inf')
    res = float('inf')

    def minDiffInBST(self, root):
        if root.left:
            self.minDiffInBST(root.left)
        self.res = min(self.res, root.val - self.pre)
        self.pre = root.val
        if root.right:
            self.minDiffInBST(root.right)
        return self.res
```
