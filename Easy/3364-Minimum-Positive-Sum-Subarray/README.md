## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and **two** integers `l` and `r`. Your task is to find the **minimum** sum of a **subarray** whose size is between `l` and `r` (inclusive) and whose sum is greater than 0.

Return the **minimum** sum of such a subarray. If no such subarray exists, return -1.

A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3, -2, 1, 4], l = 2, r = 3

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The subarrays of length between `l = 2` and `r = 3` where the sum is greater than 0 are:

- `[3, -2]` with a sum of 1

- `[1, 4]` with a sum of 5

- `[3, -2, 1]` with a sum of 2

- `[-2, 1, 4]` with a sum of 3

Out of these, the subarray `[3, -2]` has a sum of 1, which is the smallest positive sum. Hence, the answer is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-2, 2, -3, 1], l = 2, r = 3

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:**

There is no subarray of length between `l` and `r` that has a sum greater than 0. So, the answer is -1.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], l = 2, r = 4

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The subarray `[1, 2]` has a length of 2 and the minimum sum greater than 0. So, the answer is 3.

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`

- `1 <= l <= r <= nums.length`

- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Exhaustive / multi-pass search across candidate elements to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

        n = len(nums)
        ans = float('inf')
        for i in range(n):
            s = 0
            for j in range(i, n):
                s += nums[j]
                length = j - i + 1
                if l <= length <= r and s > 0:
                    ans = min(ans, s)
        return -1 if ans == float('inf') else ans
