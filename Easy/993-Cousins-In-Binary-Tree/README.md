## 📝 Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree with unique values and the values of two different nodes of the tree `x` and `y`, return `true` *if the nodes corresponding to the values *`x`* and *`y`* in the tree are **cousins**, or *`false`* otherwise.*

Two nodes of a binary tree are **cousins** if they have the same depth with different parents.

Note that in a binary tree, the root node is at the depth `0`, and children of each depth `k` node are at the depth `k + 1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
Output: false
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.

- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

- Each node has a **unique** value.

- `x != y`

- `x` and `y` are exist in the tree.

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Two-pointer linear scan adjusting window boundaries based on constraints to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

        getDepthAndParent(root, x, y, 0, null);
        return xDepth == yDepth && xParent != yParent? true: false;
    }
    //get both the depth and parent for x and y
    public void getDepthAndParent(TreeNode root, int x, int y, int depth, TreeNode parent){
        if(root == null){
            return;
        }
        if(root.val == x){
            xParent = parent;
            xDepth = depth;
        }else if(root.val == y){
            yParent = parent;
            yDepth = depth;
        }       
        getDepthAndParent(root.left, x, y, depth + 1, root);
        getDepthAndParent(root.right, x, y, depth + 1, root);
    }
}
