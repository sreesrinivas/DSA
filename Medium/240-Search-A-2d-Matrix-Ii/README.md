## 📝 Problem Statement

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:

- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.

- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`

- `n == matrix[i].length`

- `1 <= n, m <= 300`

- `-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109`

- All the integers in each row are **sorted** in ascending order.

- All the integers in each column are **sorted** in ascending order.

- `-109 <= target <= 109`

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix, target):
        r = 0
        c = len(matrix[0]) - 1
        while r < len(matrix) and c >= 0:
            if matrix[r][c] == target:
                return True
            elif matrix[r][c] > target:
                c -= 1
            else:
                r += 1
        return False
```
