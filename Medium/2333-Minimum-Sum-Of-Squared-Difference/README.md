## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given two positive **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, both of length `n`.

The **sum of squared difference** of arrays `nums1` and `nums2` is defined as the **sum** of `(nums1[i] - nums2[i])2` for each `0 <= i < n`.

You are also given two positive integers `k1` and `k2`. You can modify any of the elements of `nums1` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k1` times. Similarly, you can modify any of the elements of `nums2` by `+1` or `-1` at most `k2` times.

Return *the minimum **sum of squared difference** after modifying array *`nums1`* at most *`k1`* times and modifying array *`nums2`* at most *`k2`* times*.

**Note**: You are allowed to modify the array elements to become **negative** integers.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4], nums2 = [2,10,20,19], k1 = 0, k2 = 0
Output: 579
Explanation: The elements in nums1 and nums2 cannot be modified because k1 = 0 and k2 = 0. 
The sum of square difference will be: (1 - 2)2 + (2 - 10)2 + (3 - 20)2 + (4 - 19)2 = 579.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,4,10,12], nums2 = [5,8,6,9], k1 = 1, k2 = 1
Output: 43
Explanation: One way to obtain the minimum sum of square difference is: 
- Increase nums1[0] once.
- Increase nums2[2] once.
The minimum of the sum of square difference will be: 
(2 - 5)2 + (4 - 8)2 + (10 - 7)2 + (12 - 9)2 = 43.
Note that, there are other ways to obtain the minimum of the sum of square difference, but there is no way to obtain a sum smaller than 43.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums1.length == nums2.length`

- `1 <= n <= 105`

- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 105`

- `0 <= k1, k2 <= 109`

```java
class Solution {
    public long minSumSquareDiff(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int k1, int k2) {
        int[] d = new int[100001];
        long k = (long) k1 + k2, sum = 0;
        int max = 0;

        // Step 1: count the differences
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            int x = Math.abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
            d[x]++;
            sum += x;
            max = Math.max(max, x);
        }

        // Enough budget -> every difference becomes 0
        if (sum <= k) return 0;

        // Step 2: shave the biggest differences, level by level
        for (int i = max; i > 0 && k > 0; i--) {
            long move = Math.min(k, d[i]);
            d[i] -= move;
            d[i - 1] += move;
            k -= move;
        }

        // Step 3: add up the squares
        long ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= max; i++)
            ans += (long) i * i * d[i];

        return ans;
    }
}
