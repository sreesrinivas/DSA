## 📝 Problem Statement

There is a broken calculator that has the integer `startValue` on its display initially. In one operation, you can:

- multiply the number on display by `2`, or

- subtract `1` from the number on display.

Given two integers `startValue` and `target`, return *the minimum number of operations needed to display *`target`* on the calculator*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: startValue = 2, target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Use double operation and then decrement operation {2 -> 4 -> 3}.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: startValue = 5, target = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: Use decrement and then double {5 -> 4 -> 8}.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: startValue = 3, target = 10
Output: 3
Explanation: Use double, decrement and double {3 -> 6 -> 5 -> 10}.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= startValue, target <= 109`

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

class Solution {
public:
    int brokenCalc(int startValue, int target) {
        int result=0;
        while(target>startValue)
        {
            result++;
            if(target%2==0)
                target=target/2;
            else
                target+=1;
        }
        result=result+(startValue-target);
        return result;
    }
};
```
