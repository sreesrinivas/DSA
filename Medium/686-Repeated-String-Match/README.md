## 📝 Problem Statement

Given two strings `a` and `b`, return *the minimum number of times you should repeat string *`a`* so that string* `b` *is a substring of it*. If it is impossible for `b`​​​​​​ to be a substring of `a` after repeating it, return `-1`.

**Notice:** string `"abc"` repeated 0 times is `""`, repeated 1 time is `"abc"` and repeated 2 times is `"abcabc"`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
Output: 3
Explanation: We return 3 because by repeating a three times "abcdabcdabcd", b is a substring of it.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = "a", b = "aa"
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104`

- `a` and `b` consist of lowercase English letters.

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

    int repeatedStringMatch(string a, string b) {
        string repeat = a;
        int count = 1;

        while(repeat.size() < b.size()){
            repeat += a;
            count ++;
        }

        if(repeat.find(b) != -1){
            return count;
        }

        repeat += a;
        count++;

        if(repeat.find(b) != -1){
            return count;
        }

        return -1;
    }
