## 📝 Problem Statement

You have two soups, **A** and **B**, each starting with `n` mL. On every turn, one of the following four serving operations is chosen *at random*, each with probability `0.25` **independent** of all previous turns:

- pour 100 mL from type A and 0 mL from type B

- pour 75 mL from type A and 25 mL from type B

- pour 50 mL from type A and 50 mL from type B

- pour 25 mL from type A and 75 mL from type B

**Note:**

- There is no operation that pours 0 mL from A and 100 mL from B.

- The amounts from A and B are poured *simultaneously* during the turn.

- If an operation asks you to pour **more than** you have left of a soup, pour all that remains of that soup.

The process stops immediately after any turn in which *one of the soups* is used up.

Return the probability that A is used up *before* B, plus half the probability that both soups are used up in the** same turn**. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 50
Output: 0.62500
Explanation: 
If we perform either of the first two serving operations, soup A will become empty first.
If we perform the third operation, A and B will become empty at the same time.
If we perform the fourth operation, B will become empty first.
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.25 * (1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0) = 0.625.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 100
Output: 0.71875
Explanation: 
If we perform the first serving operation, soup A will become empty first.
If we perform the second serving operations, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2, 3], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 4.
If we perform the third operation, A will become empty on performing operation [1, 2], and both A and B become empty on performing operation 3.
If we perform the fourth operation, A will become empty on performing operation 1, and both A and B become empty on performing operation 2.
So the total probability of A becoming empty first plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time, is 0.71875.
```

 

**Constraints:**

        if N > 4800: return 1
        def f(a, b):

            if a <= 0 and b <= 0: return 0.5
            if a <= 0: return 1
            if b <= 0: return 0
            self.memo[(a, b)] = 0.25 * (f(a - 4, b) + f(a - 3, b - 1) + f(a - 2, b - 2) + f(a - 1, b - 3))
            return self.memo[(a, b)]
        N = math.ceil(N / 25.0)
        return f(N, N)
