## 📝 Problem Statement

Given two integers `a` and `b`, return *the sum of the two integers without using the operators* `+` *and* `-`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = 2, b = 3
Output: 5
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-1000 <= a, b <= 1000`

```cpp
int getSum(int x, int y){
        unsigned carry ;
        while(y != 0){
            //generate carry
            carry = x & y;
            //xor x,y and assign the result into x
            x = x ^ y;
            //left shift carry and assign into y
            y = carry << 1;            
            
        }
        return x;
    }
