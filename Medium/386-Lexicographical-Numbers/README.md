## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return all the numbers in the range `[1, n]` sorted in lexicographical order.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses `O(1)` extra space. 

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 13
Output: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`

---

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Exhaustive / multi-pass search across candidate elements to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n²)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

```cpp
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> lexicalOrder(int n) {
    List<Integer> al = new  ArrayList<>();
    int curr = 1; 
    for(int i=1; i<=n; i++)
    {
      al.add(curr);
      if(curr*10<=n)
      curr = curr*10;
      else
      {
        while(curr%10==9 || curr>=n)
        {
          curr = curr/10;   
        } 
        curr += 1;
      }
    } 
    return al;

    }
}
```
