## 📝 Problem Statement

We build a table of `n` rows (**1-indexed**). We start by writing `0` in the `1st` row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of `0` with `01`, and each occurrence of `1` with `10`.

- For example, for `n = 3`, the `1st` row is `0`, the `2nd` row is `01`, and the `3rd` row is `0110`.

Given two integer `n` and `k`, return the `kth` (**1-indexed**) symbol in the `nth` row of a table of `n` rows.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: row 1: 0
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: 
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 30`

- `1 <= k <= 2n - 1`

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int kthGrammar(int N, int K) {
	if (N == 1) return 0;
	if (K % 2 == 0) return (kthGrammar(N - 1, K / 2) == 0) ? 1 : 0;
	else return (kthGrammar(N - 1, (K + 1) / 2) == 0) ? 0 : 1;
    }
};
```
