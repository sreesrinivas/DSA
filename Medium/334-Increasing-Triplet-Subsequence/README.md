## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true`* if there exists a triple of indices *`(i, j, k)`* such that *`i < j < k`* and *`nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`. If no such indices exists, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: Any triplet where i < j < k is valid.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: No triplet exists.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [2,1,5,0,4,6]
Output: true
Explanation: One of the valid triplet is (1, 4, 5), because nums[1] == 1 < nums[4] == 4 < nums[5] == 6.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 105`

- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

 

**Follow up:** Could you implement a solution that runs in `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity?

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

           else return true;
```
