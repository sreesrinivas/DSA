## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of the longest **strictly increasing ******subsequence***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`

- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

 

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Dynamic programming / memoized recursion approach storing overlapping subproblems to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
