## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an n-ary tree, return the *level order* traversal of its nodes' values.

*Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [[1],[3,2,4],[5,6]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [[1],[2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10],[11,12,13],[14]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`

- The total number of nodes is between `[0, 104]`

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

class Solution {
    vector<vector<int>> ans;
public:
    vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(Node* root,int level=0) {
        if(!root) return ans;
        if(ans.size()<=level) ans.push_back({root->val});
        else ans[level].push_back(root->val);
        for(Node* node: root->children) levelOrder(node,level+1);
        return ans;
    }
};
