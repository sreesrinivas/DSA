## 📝 Problem Statement

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return *the minimum number of **steps** required to make* `word1` *and* `word2` *the same*.

In one **step**, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
Output: 4
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`

- `word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Dynamic programming / memoized recursion approach storing overlapping subproblems to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

        }

        return dp[i][j] = min(
            1 + solve(str, st, i, j - 1, dp),
            1 + solve(str, st, i - 1, j, dp)
        );
    }

public:
    int minDistance(string word1, string word2) {
        int n = word1.length();
        int m = word2.length();

        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(m, -1));

        return solve(word1, word2, n - 1, m - 1, dp);
    }
