## 📝 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper and `citations` is sorted in **non-descending order**, return *the researcher's h-index*.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: citations = [1,2,100]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == citations.length`

- `1 <= n <= 105`

- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

- `citations` is sorted in **ascending order**.

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Binary search approach dividing the search range logarithmically to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (citations[mid] >= n - mid) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return n - left; 
    }
}
```
