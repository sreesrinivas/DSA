## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters and an integer array `shifts` of the same length.

Call the `shift()` of a letter, the next letter in the alphabet, (wrapping around so that `'z'` becomes `'a'`).

- For example, `shift('a') = 'b'`, `shift('t') = 'u'`, and `shift('z') = 'a'`.

Now for each `shifts[i] = x`, we want to shift the first `i + 1` letters of `s`, `x` times.

Return *the final string after all such shifts to s are applied*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc", shifts = [3,5,9]
Output: "rpl"
Explanation: We start with "abc".
After shifting the first 1 letters of s by 3, we have "dbc".
After shifting the first 2 letters of s by 5, we have "igc".
After shifting the first 3 letters of s by 9, we have "rpl", the answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaa", shifts = [1,2,3]
Output: "gfd"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`

- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

- `shifts.length == s.length`

- `0 <= shifts[i] <= 109`

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Optimal iterative solution using a single pass to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

    public String shiftingLetters(String s, int[] shifts) {
        char[] ch = s.toCharArray();
        long shiftSum =0;
        for(int i = shifts.length-1; i >=0 ; i--){
            shiftSum  += shifts[i];
            ch[i] = (char)('a' + (ch[i] -'a' + shiftSum) % 26);
        }
        return new String(ch);
    }
}
