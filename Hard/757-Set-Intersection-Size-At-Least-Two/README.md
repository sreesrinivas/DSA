## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` represents all the integers from `starti` to `endi` inclusively.

A **containing set** is an array `nums` where each interval from `intervals` has **at least two** integers in `nums`.

- For example, if `intervals = [[1,3], [3,7], [8,9]]`, then `[1,2,4,7,8,9]` and `[2,3,4,8,9]` are **containing sets**.

Return *the minimum possible size of a containing set*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[3,7],[8,9]]
Output: 5
Explanation: let nums = [2, 3, 4, 8, 9].
It can be shown that there cannot be any containing array of size 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[3,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: let nums = [2, 3, 4].
It can be shown that there cannot be any containing array of size 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[4,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
It can be shown that there cannot be any containing array of size 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 3000`

- `intervals[i].length == 2`

- `0 <= starti < endi <= 108`

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Sorting-based greedy or two-pointer approach to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n log n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`

```python
class Solution(object):
    def intersectionSizeTwo(self, intervals):
        intervals.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))

        ans = 0
        a, b = -1, -1

        for l, r in intervals:
            if l > b:
                a = r - 1
                b = r
                ans += 2
            elif l > a:
                a = b
                b = r
                ans += 1

        return ans
```
