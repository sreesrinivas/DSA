## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given `k` identical eggs and you have access to a building with `n` floors labeled from `1` to `n`.

You know that there exists a floor `f` where `0 <= f <= n` such that any egg dropped at a floor **higher** than `f` will **break**, and any egg dropped **at or below** floor `f` will **not break**.

Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor `x` (where `1 <= x <= n`). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may **reuse** it in future moves.

Return *the **minimum number of moves** that you need to determine **with certainty** what the value of *`f` is.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 1, n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know that f = 0.
Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know that f = 1.
If it does not break, then we know f = 2.
Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 2, n = 6
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: k = 3, n = 14
Output: 4
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 100`

- `1 <= n <= 104`

## 💡 Solution Explanation

Dynamic programming / memoized recursion approach storing overlapping subproblems to satisfy all problem constraints with optimal runtime performance.

### ⏱️ Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`

public:
    int dp[101][10001];
    int solve(int e,int f){
        if(e==1)return f;//e==0 is an invalid input
        if(f==0 || f==1)return f;
        if(dp[e][f]!=-1)return dp[e][f];
        int mn=INT_MAX;
        for(int k=1;k<=f;k++){
            //here, max because of worst case includes all attemps
            int temp=1+max(solve(e-1,k-1),solve(e,f-k));//at kth floor if it's break, if it's not breaks
            mn=min(mn,temp);//min attempts to find the threshold floor
        }
        return dp[e][f]=mn;
    }
    int superEggDrop(int e, int f) {
        memset(dp,-1,sizeof(dp));
        return solve(e,f);
    }
};
